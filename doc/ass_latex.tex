\section{Executive Summary}
\section{Introduction}
  Owning a house is one of the biggest investments a person can make. As such, it 
  is of great interest to prospective buyers, sellers and lenders to accurately
  predict the price of a home. There are a range of models and techniques that 
  attempt to predict the price of a home, from observational appraisals all 
  the way to machine learning models\cite{hedonic_ai}. One method widely studied is that of
  hedonic pricing. A Hedonic Pricing Model (henceforth, HPM) is a model that 
  attempts to estimate the price of a good by taking its observable characteristics
  and then weighting them according to their relative impact on the price. Models
  utilise a range of measures that can be categorised into several groups, 
  namely structural, neighbourhood, and environmental. \cite{hedonic_rev} Hearth and Maier,
  in a literature review of HPMs for real estate, had identified that the 
  neighbourhood and environmental factors were generally over-researched. While
  social factors and the "implicit value of structural characteristics" was 
  under-researched.\cite{lit_rev}

  \subsection{Related Work}
  There appears to be a consensus that creating a HPM, particularly focussing on
  structural characteristics, has problems with heteroskedasticity. This means
  that linear models may not be entirely appropriate to estimate the response.
  This was sought to be relieved by Selim, Limsombunchai and Malpezzi by using
  a semi-logarithmic form wherein the response variable is transformed by the natural log.
  \cite{hedonic_ai, hedonic_rev, hedonic_regress} Additionally, Malpezzi explains
  that this effectively allows value added to the house to be proportional to 
  other variables in the model and for an easier interpretation of coefficients
  such that the coefficient of a measure is the percentage change for 1 unit 
  difference in the measure.\cite{hedonic_rev}
  In the end Selim concluded that water system, presence of a pool, the type of house,
  number of rooms, house size, locational characteristics and building type were
  the most significant variables to affect house prices in the country of Turkey.
  \cite{hedonic_regress}
    
  \subsection{Data Set}
  The data set contains data on houses in Saratoga County, New York; collected by
  Candice Corvetti in 2006. It contains 1063 randomly selected observations collecting
  data on house price, size in square feet, number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms,
  the presence of a fireplace, land size in acres and the age of the house in years.
  
  \subsection{Aim}
  The aim of this report is to fit a model that will attempt to determine how 
  the price of a house depends on the other variables provided. Significant 
  variables that appear in the Turkish model will be explored in the Saratoga 
  data set to see if they also play a significant role in predicting house price.
